This Java program was developed and executed using an online Java compiler. The purpose of the application is to demonstrate how a Java program can consume a public REST API, process the received data, and display it in a structured format. The program uses Java’s built-in HttpClient to send an HTTP GET request to a public API and receive the response in JSON format.
After receiving the response, the program parses the JSON data using basic string operations without relying on any external libraries. The extracted information is then displayed clearly in the console, making it easy to understand the API output. This approach helps in learning the fundamentals of REST API integration, HTTP requests, and JSON handling in Java.
This application can be used in internship tasks, academic mini-projects, and Java learning exercises to understand backend communication with web services. It is also useful for beginners who want to learn how real-time data is fetched from external sources such as weather services, user information systems, or public data platforms.
The program is platform-independent and can run on any system that supports Java 11 or higher. Since it is executed using an online compiler, it does not require complex setup or configuration, making it suitable for quick testing and demonstrations. Overall, this project provides a practical understanding of REST API consumption and is a good foundation for building more advanced Java-based applications.
